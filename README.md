## Project 2 Investigate a Dataset: TMDb movie data

### This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from
The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe characters.
- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
- The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

### Questions after analysis will be answered:
- Which genres are most popular from year to year? 
- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
